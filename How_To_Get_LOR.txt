Hi Aditya Agarwal,

We are extremely happy to introduce the Letter of Recommendation (LoR) which we provide based on your performance and the efforts you have taken, 
not just to accomplish your own task but also in helping others in their tasks and queries. Showing such characteristics beyond the requirements will make you considerable for LoR. 

LoR is not an on-demand document and is not sent to all interns to apply for. Your mentors will observe your activities and invite you selectively to apply for LoR. 
Such activities would include:



LINKEDIN: Resolve at least 10 queries from interns posted in TSF Network.
TASKS: Have completed more tasks than fellow interns delivering best quality. There is no upper limit on tasks. More the tasks you do, the better are your chances for an LoR invitation.
Peer Evaluation: Evaluate 10+ tasks posted different interns.
TSF OUTREACH: Do at least 1 task from the non-technical category. Non-technical interns can do one additional task from a different domain.
OTHERS: Any other way you have helped TSF or TSF Students.
OPTIONAL: Promoting TSF's FB/LinkedIn pages.
After your tasks are evaluated and you are eligible for LoR, we will share a form to apply for LoR. Thereafter, you will be enrolled for a 2-months' mentorship program during which you will be under the guidance of GRIP Program Leader and resolve interns' queries related to tasks working as a Student Mentor.




Successful Student Mentors will get a Letter of Recommendation to help them in career and academic progression. 

Please do not reply to this email. 

 

Best Regards,
GRIP | The Sparks Foundation
